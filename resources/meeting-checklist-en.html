                    by Design from the start: meeting or event planners are encouraged to consider accessibility from
                    the start, and not implement it after the fact.
                </li>
                <li class="mrgn-bttm-md"><span class="far fa-square mrgn-rght-md" aria-hidden="true"></span>In the

                    (SLI), Communication Access Real-time Translation (CART - the instant translation of spoken word
                    into displayed text), large fonts, etc., should contact the organizer as soon as possible in order
                    to ensure availability of services. A deadline should be provided for such requests to be sent to
                    the organizer to ensure accommodations can be secured.
                    <ul>
                        <li>If participants do require accommodations, follow-up to confirm if they will be providing
                            their own or if they would like you to arrange services. Ask if they have a preferred
                            service provider.

                <li class="mrgn-bttm-md"><span class="far fa-square mrgn-rght-md" aria-hidden="true"></span>Indicate how
                    participants’ confidential information will be handled, who will have access this information, and
                    provide a link to the privacy policy on accommodation needs.
                    <ul>
                        <li>For example: Any and all accommodations requested will be kept confidential and only used
                            for the purposes of procuring accessibility services.</li>
                    </ul>

                <li class="mrgn-bttm-md"><span class="far fa-square mrgn-rght-md" aria-hidden="true"></span>For an
                    open-door type meeting where you have no way of knowing the needs of your participants, then you
                    should provide as many accommodations as possible, including but not limited to: simultaneous
                    English/French translation, CART, sign language interpreters in both American Sign Language (ASL -
                    English) and Langue des signes québécoise (LSQ - French). You will need to secure official language
                    interpretation (English – French) if you expect to have both languages spoken during the event.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Please see Annex A for additional information regarding CART services and SLI. </li>
                        <li>Note that adding multiple accommodation features may increase technical complexity (e.g.
                            need for multiple channels for simultaneous interpretation), and what accommodates one
                            person may create a barrier to someone else, so organizers should engage early with IITB if
                            special accommodations are required.</li>
