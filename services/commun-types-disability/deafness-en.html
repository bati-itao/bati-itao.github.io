        <p>The term "hearing impaired" describes people with any degree of hearing loss, from mild to profound, including those who are deaf and those who are hard of hearing.</p>
        <h2>Information and Awareness on Accessibility Topics</h2>
        <p>The IT Accessibility Office offers awareness services. We provide information on accessibility related
            matters.</p>
        <p>The term "hearing impaired" describes people with any degree of hearing loss. This ranges from hard of
            hearing to complete deafness.</p>
        <h3>Definition of various levels of hearing loss</h3>
        <dl>
            <dt>Deaf</dt>
            <dd>Refers to a person with hearing loss so severe that there is very little or no functional hearing.</dd>
            <dt>Deafened</dt>
            <dd>Usually refers to a person who becomes deaf as an adult.</dd>
            <dt>Hard-of-hearing</dt>
            <dd>Refers to a person with hearing loss where there may be enough residual hearing that an auditory device,
                such as a hearing aid or a frequency-modulation system, provides adequate assistance to process speech.
            </dd>
        </dl>
        <p>Some people also may have overly sensitive hearing (Hyperacusis) in one or both ears.</p>

        <h2>Client's Need Assessment of Adaptive Technology (AT)</h2>
        <p>The IT Accessibility Office offers insight and guidance in meeting the needs for those who are hearing
            impaired. By developing a strategy suited to individual needs, we can determine the best adaptive technology
            (AT) to be made available for client use.</p>


        <h2>General Requests for Adaptive Technology (AT)</h2>
        <p>You may submit a general inquiry. The IT Accessibility Office is dedicated to respond to general requests for
            adaptive Technology (AT).</p>

        <h2>Loan Bank Services</h2>
            <p>The IT Accessibility Office maintains, reviews and procures adaptive technology for a short-term loan bank. Items loaned out can be evaluated to determine if they are useful to individuals who are hearing impaired. Visit <a href="https://bati-itao.github.io/resources/at-lists-en.html">Adaptive Technology</a> for more information.</p>

            <p>If Loan Bank services are required, please submit a request via our <a href="https://a11y.itaormt-batiogd-int.service.cloud-nuage.canada.ca/openrequest-en.php">request intake form <i class="fas fa-external-link-square-alt" aria-hidden="true"></i><span class="wb-inv">Lien interne</span></a>.</p>
