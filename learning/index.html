            will require Innovation, Information and Technology Branch (IITB)
            employees to be aware of their obligations to ensure an accessible
            work environment. The list of courses will provide an opportunity
            for employees to increase their knowledge of accessibility and to
            better serve internal and external clients. It will also be an
            opportunity for various target audiences such as Project Managers,
            IITB developers, programmers and technicians to proactively provide
            accessible services, software and programs that bring the greatest
            value to our colleagues who use ACT (adaptive computer technology).

            The ESDC Self-Paced Web Accessibility Course is a free, self-study,
            text-based, online course covering a variety of web accessibility
            topics. The topics are organized into 11 modules based on common
            tasks in a web project, such as how to implement accessible page
            structure, links, tables, images and forms. Other topics include
            visual design, responsive design, multimedia, input modalities and
            ARIA. This course shows you how to develop web sites and web content
            that is accessible to people with disabilities, which improves user
            experience for everyone. The course concepts can also be applied to
            non-web applications and content.

          </h3>
          <p>With this learning path, you will have a basic understanding of the
            technologies that the Web is built on, a basic understanding of
            accessibility as it pertains to the Web, mobile, documents, and
            eventually desktop; and how to build and evaluate rich internet
            applications. No course can be exhaustive. Most knowledge will be
            gained through experience. This learning path will lay the
            foundation allowing you to build upon it as you practice web
            development and accessibility auditing.
