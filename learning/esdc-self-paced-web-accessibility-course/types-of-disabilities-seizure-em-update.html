			<section aria-label="Low Vision">
				<h2 id="low-vision">Low Vision</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>W3C defines low vision as “poor acuity (vision that is not sharp), tunnel vision (seeing only the middle of the visual field), central field loss (seeing only the edges of the visual field), and clouded vision. </li>
					<li>Low vision includes people with cataracts, diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, hemianopia, macular degeneration, retinal detachment, etc.</li>
					<li>Vision loss can take many forms and it can be mild or quite extreme. For example, consider this image as seen with normal vision:
					  <ul class="list-unstyled">
					    <li><img src="images/image8.jpg" class="img-responsive mrgn-bttm-md" alt=" One boy embraces another. Both are smiling each holds a ball."></li>
					    <li> Some people have hypersensitivity to glare:
					      <ul class="list-unstyled">
					        <li><img src="images/image9.jpg" class="img-responsive mrgn-bttm-md" alt=" Bright areas of the image appear to glow white, hiding details."></li>
				          </ul>
					    </li>
					    <li>Some people may be colorblind:
					      <ul class="list-unstyled">
					        <li><img src="images/imagea.jpg" class="img-responsive mrgn-bttm-md" alt=" the reds of the image are desaturated. Orange appears green."></li>
				          </ul>
					    </li>
					    <li>Some people may see an entire image, but it might be either blurred or clouded:
					      <ul class="list-unstyled">
					        <li><img src="images/imageb.jpg" class="img-responsive mrgn-bttm-md" alt=""></li>
				          </ul>
					    </li>
					    <li>while others might see the center of the image often referred to as tunnel vision
					      <ul class="list-unstyled">
					        <li><img src="images/imagec.jpg" class="img-responsive mrgn-bttm-md" alt=" A rough circle of high detail is visible, about 20% of the image."></li>
				          </ul>
					    </li>
					    <li>And others still might see the edges of the image often called peripheral vision
					      <ul class="list-unstyled">
					        <li><img src="images/imaged.jpg" class="img-responsive mrgn-bttm-md" alt=" the centre 20% of the image is obscured by a grey circle"></li>

				<li>Low contrast causes barriers to interaction, as users may be unable to identify their location on a page, the state of links and controls, read text, or identify the content of images.  </li>
					<li>People with low vision may enlarge text or change fonts, colours and spacing to make content more usable for their needs. </li>
					<li>People with a restricted field of view may not enlarge text, but benefit from responsive design (to narrow the display), from related information being grouped together, and from labels and controls being positioned closely to one another.</li>

			<section aria-label="Colour-blind">
				<h2 id="colour-blind">Colour-blind</h2>
				<p>The W3C defines colour blindness as “<q>difficulty distinguishing between colors such as between red and green, or between yellow and blue, and sometimes inability to perceive any color.</q>”</p>
				<p>Barriers for these users manifest anywhere colour alone communicates meaning. For instance, a form indicating required fields with a red label and no asterisk, or a link using blue without any other visual enhancement (an underline, 3:1 contrast with neighbouring text, border, etc.).</p>
				<p>In the colour blindness simulation below, the red and green columns of the bar chart are barely distinguishable. The solution here is adding a background pattern, but the bars could also be labelled with visible text.</p>
				<h3>Simulation of red-green colour blindness</h3>
				<p>The original image:</p>
				<img src="images/image6.png" class="img-responsive" alt=" A bar chart using green, blue and red bars.">
				<p>Protanopia (red colour blind) simulation:</p>
				<img src="images/image7.png" class="img-responsive" alt=" With the protanopia filter, the red and green colours become similarly brown. ">
                
                <h3 class="text-success"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok-circle"></span> Good Example: Using a background pattern</h3>
				
				<p>In this example, background patterns are used to identify the three categories x, y and z. Colour is no longer solely communicating the meaning.</p>
				<img src="images/image5.png" class="img-responsive" alt="">
				<h3>Designing for colour blindness</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Ensure sufficient contrast between text and background colour.</li>
					<li>Do not use colour as the only visual means of conveying information (e.g., associate a text label or introduce a background pattern in addition to colour).</li>
					<li>Ensure links are visually distinguishable from neighbouring text with more than colour.</li>
				</ul>
			</section>
			<section aria-label="Deaf">
				<h2 id="deaf">Deaf</h2>
				<p>W3 defines auditory disability is a from mild or moderate hearing loss in one or both ears (“hard of hearing”) to substantial and uncorrectable hearing loss in both ears (“deafness”). People with auditory disabilities can’t hear the audio, prefer audio content in another form or in conjunction with captions.</p>
				<p>Most of the web is in a visual or text format. It is vital to make audio content accessible to users with a hearing impairment.</p>
				<h3>Designing for deaf</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Provide captions for video content</li>
					<li>Provide audio description or transcript for video content</li>
					<li>Provide transcript for audio-only content</li>
					<li>Provide transcript or audio description for video-only content</li>
					<li>Ensure the video’s captions are in sync with the audio speech and important sounds. </li>
					<li>Ensure Closed Captions / subtitles are easy to read. A good contrast, are a decent size and are set against a background so they don't get lost in the video background that changes. </li>
					<li>Users should have the options to stop, pause, and adjust the volume of audio content (independently of the system volume).</li>
					<li>Ensure the transcript identifies speakers and includes all the dialog, important sounds, and narration.</li>
				</ul>

			<section aria-label="Deaf-blindness">
				<h2 id="deaf-blindness">Deaf-blindness</h2>
				<p>People who are Deaf-blind use a screen reader with a refreshable braille display to read, which users feel with their fingers. </p>
				<p>People who are deaf-blind can only access multimedia content (audio only, video only, and video with audio) via its transcript. They cannot hear the audio, see the video or read the captions. Audio files need a basic transcript of the audio content, and video files need a descriptive transcript where both the audio and critical visual information is communicated. </p>
				<h3>Designing for deafblind:</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Considerations for blind and deaf users apply, though video captions are inaccessible to braille in most assistive technology.</li>
					<li>Provide basic transcripts of audio files and descriptive transcripts of video files (transcripts that include all audio and all critical visual information).</li>
				</ul>
				<h3>Braille Device</h3>
				<p>The braille device is typically situated directly below the keyboard. Screen readers intercept the page content and send the characters to the Braille device.</p>

			<section aria-label="Motor Disabilities">
				<h2 id="motor-disabilities">Motor Disabilities</h2>
				<p>Motor disabilities can refer to a range of physical experiences. </p>
				<p>Using a mouse is often not an option. Users may have a temporary inability to use a single hand due to an injury, difficulty using or controlling their hands, little to no motor control of their limbs, or missing limbs/hands. </p>
				<p>People with motor disabilities often use alternate keyboards or input devices that act as keyboard emulators. Keyboard emulators include speech recognition software, sip and puff device, on-screen keyboards, scanning software and other assistive technologies. </p>
				<p>It’s important to ensure all functionality of the content is operable through a keyboard interface.</p>

			<section aria-label="Cognitive, Learning, and Neurological Disabilities">
				<h2 id="disabilities">Cognitive, Learning, and Neurological Disabilities</h2>
				<p>Cognitive disabilities are by far the most common type of disability. According to the W3C-WAI,  cognitive, learning and neurological disabilities affect any part of the nervous system and impact how well people hear, move, see, speak, and understand information. Cognitive, learning, and neurological disabilities do not necessarily affect the intelligence of a person.</p>
				<h3>Examples of cognitive, learning, and neurological disabilities</h3>
                <dl>
                <dt>Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)</dt>  <dd>involves difficulty focusing on a single task, focusing for longer periods, or being easily distracted.</dd>
				<dt>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) (includes “autism,” “Asperger syndrome,” and “<q>pervasive developmental disorder</q>” (PDD))</dt><dd>involves impairments of social communication and interaction abilities, and sometimes restricted habits and interests.</dd>
				<dt>Intellectual disabilities (sometimes called “learning disabilities” in Europe and some other countries, and “developmental disabilities” in other regions)</dt> <dd>involves impairments of intelligence, learning more slowly, or difficulty understanding complex concepts. Down syndrome is one among many different causes of intellectual disabilities.</dd>
				<dt>Learning disabilities</dt><dd>is a functional term rather than a medical condition, and is not uniformly defined. In Europe and some other countries, it refers to intellectual disabilities, while in Australia, Canada, the U.S., and some other countries it refers to perceptual disabilities.</dd>
				<dt>Mental health disabilities</dt><dd> includes anxiety, delirium, depression, paranoia, schizophrenia, and many other disorders. These conditions may cause difficulty focusing on information, processing information, or understanding it. In particular, medication for these disorders may have side effects including blurred vision, hand tremors, and other impairments.</dd>
				<dt>Memory impairments</dt><dd> involves limited short-term memory, missing long-term memory, or limited ability to recall language. Dementia is one among many different causes of memory impairments.</dd>
				<dt>Multiple sclerosis</dt><dd> causes damage to nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord, and can affect auditory, cognitive, physical, or visual abilities, in particular during relapses.</dd>
				<dt>Neurodiversity</dt><dd> is a societal rather than medical term to describe the natural diversity in neurocognitive functioning, like gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation, and disability.</dd>
				<dt>Perceptual disabilities (sometimes called “learning disabilities” in Australia, Canada, the U.S., and some other countries)</dt><dd> involves difficulty processing auditory, tactile, visual, or other sensory information. This can impact reading (dyslexia), writing (dysgraphia), processing numbers (dyscalculia), or spatial and temporal orientation.</dd>
				<dt>Seizure disorders</dt><dd> includes different types of epilepsy and migraines, which may be in reaction to visual flickering or audio signals at certain frequencies or patterns.</dd></dl>
				<h3>Examples of barriers for people with cognitive, learning, and neurological disabilities</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Complex navigation mechanisms and page layouts that are difficult to understand and use.</li>
					<li>Complex sentences that are difficult to read and unusual words that are difficult to understand.</li>
					<li>Long passages of text without images, graphs, or other illustrations to highlight the context.</li>
					<li>Moving, blinking, or flickering content, and background audio that cannot be turned off.</li>
					<li>Web browsers and media players that do not provide mechanisms to suppress animations and audio.</li>
					<li>Visual page designs that cannot be adapted using web browser controls or custom style sheets.</li>
				</ul>
				<h3>Designing for cognitive, learning, and neurological disabilities</h3>
				<p>People with cognitive, learning, and neurological disabilities often rely on:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Clearly structured content that facilitates overview and orientation;</li>
					<li>Consistent labeling of forms, buttons, and other content parts;</li>
					<li>Predictable link targets, functionality, and overall interaction;</li>
					<li>Different ways of navigating websites, such as hierarchical menu and search;</li>
					<li>Options to suppress blinking, flickering, flashing, and otherwise distracting content;</li>
					<li>Simpler text that is supplemented by images, graphs, and other illustrations;</li>
				</ul>
				<p>The Canada.ca Style Guide requires that externally-facing content have a grade 8 reading level, and internally-facing content have a grade 10 reading level. A measurement tool, the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level test, is available in English only in Microsoft Word under the spelling and grammar options. The readability measurement tool <a href="www.scolarius.com">www.scolarius.com</a> offers a similar metric for French text: a score between 50 and 89 corresponds to the primary level of education, between 90 an 119 at the high school level, 120 and 149 at the college level, from 150 to 189 at the university level.</p>
				<p>Most information in this article is from the Web Accessibility Initiative (<a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/">WAI</a>) document: <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/people-use-web/abilities-barriers">Diverse Abilities and Barriers</a>.

				<h3>Seizures</h3>
				<p>Rapidly flashing lights or strobe-like effects in video, graphics or animation can cause photo-epileptic seizures in users with photosensitive epilepsy. Also known as convulsions, these are a sudden, uncontrolled electrical disturbance in the brain that can cause physical harm.</p>
				<p>Flashing lights can trigger a seizure if:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Lights flash more than 3 times per second.</li>
					<li>The flashing content is large enough. WCAG provides a complex formula here, but the rule of thumb is flashing content larger than 21,824 square pixels is problematic.</li>
					<li>The flashing content has high contrast. WCAG provides another complex formula here, but as an alternative recommends assessing flashing content using a tool such as the <a href="http://trace.umd.edu/peat">Photosensitive Epilepsy Analysis Tool (PEAT).</a></li>
				</ul>
				<p>Because users may magnify the page and so enlarge the flashing area, it’s safest to limit the flashing of <em>any</em> size content to no more than three flashes in any 1-second period</p>
				<h4 id="idelem4x5670">Designing for Seizure Disorders</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Don't include flashing light sequences of 3 times or more per second in videos, animations, or transitions. If you can’t edit the source, don’t use it.</li>
