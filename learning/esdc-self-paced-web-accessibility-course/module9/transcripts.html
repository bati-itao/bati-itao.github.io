				<h2 id="trans-overview">Overview – Transcripts</h2>
				<p><strong><dfn>Basic transcripts</dfn></strong> are a text version of the speech and non-speech audio information needed to understand the content. <strong><dfn>Descriptive transcripts</dfn></strong> also include text description of the visual information needed to understand the content. Basic transcripts benefit users who are deaf and users who have difficulty processing auditory information. Descriptive transcripts benefit users who are blind or deaf-blind and users who process text information better than audio and visual/pictorial information. </p>
				<p>Transcripts are also used by people without disabilities in a variety of situations:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>As an alternative to watching or listening. For many users, this is significantly easier and faster. Some users will want to skim the transcript before playing the media. Other users will want to save data on mobile.</li>
					<li>Used offline, printed or converted to braille.</li>
					<li>To help locate the document via search. Text transcripts are indexed by search engines, making the page more findable.</li>
				</ul>
			</section>
			
			<section>				
				<h2 id="trans-need">Do you need a transcript?</h2>
				<p>For pre-recorded media:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Video with audio</strong> requires a descriptive transcript. </li>
					<li><strong>Video-only</strong> requires a descriptive transcript or audio description.</li>
					<li><strong>Audio-only</strong> content requires a basic transcript.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>For live media broadcasts on the web: </p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Video with audio</strong> Transcripts are not applicable for live video (live captions are required)</li>
					<li><strong>Video-only</strong> may have a descriptive transcript (optional).</li>
					<li><strong>Audio-only</strong> requires either captions or a basic transcript.</li>
				</ul>

				<h2 id="incl-trans">What is included in a transcript?</h2>
				<p>For what to include in a basic transcript, see the page <a href="https://bati-itao.github.io/learning/esdc-self-paced-web-accessibility-course/module9/transcribing-audio.html">Transcribing Audio to text for guidance on speech and non-speech audio information</a>.

						<p>Use of Personal Protective Equipment when Caring for a Person Under Investigation for Ebola Virus Disease in a First Nations or other Community Health Facility</p>
						<p>This training video is based on advice from the Public Health Agency of Canada's Infection Prevention and Control Expert Working Group.</p>
						<p>TEXT ON-SCREEN: 'Advice on Infection Prevention and Control Measures for Ebola Virus Disease in Healthcare Settings (Date Modified: 2015-05-19). Canada.ca/EBOLAVIRUS'.</p>

						<p>"My colleague, Dr. David Butler-Jones, and I would like to tell you about this very important initiative to help keep our health care workers safe and ensure they are prepared for infectious disease threats including Ebola or other hemorrhagic fevers.</p>
						<p>Health Canada is pleased to collaborate with the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada and the Public Health Agency of Canada to bring you these training videos. They will show how to put on and take off the personal protective equipment needed when caring for patients suspected or confirmed to have Ebola Virus Disease, in a First Nations community health setting.</p>
						<p>Training and repeated practice is necessary to ensure when personal protective equipment is used, it is done so in a correct and safe way. These videos are to be used along with the in-person training."</p>

				<p>It's the not the type of thing... I think you can't sit down and write out a formula and say if you meet that formula you are going to be a good leader. I, I found out, part of the... I think I became a good leader and I think part of that was because when I was eighteen, I had a guy for god sakes in the crew that joined the RAF the year before I was born. I'm the youngest incidently of the ten crew members, so you grow up in a hurry, and I think you have to know your people. Now I work in a service club and have now for 45 years and one of the biggest tasks is to get the presidents and that to realize that every member in their club is different and you better have an ear for everyone of them. We'd go to, I went to staff college and studied leadership. We left staff college realizing you can't define it. You know, some people say you either got it or you haven't got it. I don't know whether it goes back that far into your genes or not. I think consideration for people, I think being yourself, not a lot of the things that they teach you out of a book, no. And the other too, you know, I think you got to, you got to live it, you know. I flew for 31 years. I'm sure it annoyed my wife many, many a time, you know, because you always had to go somewhere and they were always at the least convenient time, but you do it. And you set by example, I think is a part of leadership.</p>
