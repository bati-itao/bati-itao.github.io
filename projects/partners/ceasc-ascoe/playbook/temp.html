                <h3>Barrier-free access for everyone</h3>
                <p>Over the years, many decisions were made to better serve Canadians. However, some of these decisions might have created obstacles that make it difficult, or even sometimes impossible, for persons with disabilities to access government programs and services.</p>
                <section>
                    <h4>What is accessibility</h4>
                    <p>Accessibility can be described as the &ldquo;ability to access&rdquo; without encountering any barriers. Barriers are the obstacles for persons with disabilities that prevents them from doing the things many of us take for granted. In practice, accessibility is about having a barrier-free access, being treated with dignity, having meaningful options for interacting with government and getting consistent information everywhere across all service channels. <strong>Everyone benefits from accessibility.</strong></p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h4>Why accessibility matters</h4>
                    <p>The Government of Canada serves millions of people that have diverse needs and expectations. The challenge is to serve them better equally. We need to change because it is the right thing to do. Accessibility is about respecting <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/canadian-heritage/services/rights-people-disabilities.html">human rights</a>. <strong>All Canadians are entitled to receive government services and benefits. </strong></p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h4>Your role as a public servant</h4>
                    <p>Your job is to make sure that all Canadians have meaningful options for interacting with government, regardless of their personal situation. Learn from each other so that you can do better. <strong>Equitable access should be part of what we do every day.</strong></p>

                <h3>Existing client service barriers</h3>
                <p>Check out five service areas that were identified as creating challenges for people living with a disability or functional limitation.</p>
                <section>
                    <h4>Physical Space</h4>
                    <p>Clients may find it difficult to travel to a building because of the location. For others it could be signage that is not clearly in their line-of-sight or it might be the background noise that is disturbing. Some design elements can make it difficult to use stairs or navigate doorways and hallways. For some, the layout of the rooms and how the furniture is displayed can be a tripping hazard. In addition, features such as plexiglas barriers can also cause challenges for clients with hearing impairment.</p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h4>Policies &amp; Processes</h4>
                    <p>The policies and processes you create to implement existing laws and regulations can make access difficult for clients and have negative impacts on client needs and expectations. An example would be a service representative that is not authorized to fill out a form on behalf of the client. This can present a barrier to accessing a service or benefit.</p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h4>Language &amp; Information</h4>
                    <p>Clients may not be able to understand if the information is too complex, government communications has earned a reputation for being difficult to understand. Accessible formats &ndash; and accessible ways to obtaining accessible formats &ndash; can</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;not be an afterthought. Similarly, sign language interpretation and not forcing screen readers to go through long privacy statements that sighted clients can scroll past, are essential elements of respect.</p>
                    <p>Communicating in plain language is essential for some people with disabilities to access information.</p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h4>Awareness &amp; Attitude</h4>
                    <p>If you do not promote accessibility features, clients may not feel confident in their abilities to access your program or service. Client can miss out on important information if communication is not effective and timely. If employees do not have proper training, it may result in misunderstanding, confusing or dismissive behaviour. It may also lead to assumptions or unfair judgments about a person&rsquo;s ability or appearance. Always remember that everyone deserves to be treated with dignity.</p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h4>Technology</h4>
                    <p>Some systems are not set up or designed to support the use of appropriate tools and devices such as screen readers, accessible keyboards and audio player. This also applies to systems that do not allow for compatibility with client assistive devices used at home. For example, the accessibility of websites and electronic equipment within the premises such as wayfinding devices, accessible self-service kiosks, the need to use a joystick instead of a mouse, etc. The World Wide Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) is the starting point, always strive to do better.</p>

            <section>
                <h3>Someone living with a physical disability or a condition affecting mobility and agility</h3>
                <p>Many in this client group have visible disabilities. It is important to keep proper accessibility measures up to date, well understood, tested and maintained for functionality. Any improvements should go beyond the building codes and standards. For example, make it a business requirement to have service centres located near public transit, have parking close to the main entrance and test automatic door openers each day as part of standard procedures. This can help ensure the clients have a positive experience, even before they interact with your employees. Enable clients to get to your office and move around easily by having ramps where necessary, wide hallways and doorways, and accessible washrooms. Also think about integrating multi-level counters as part of your interior design standards.</p>
                <p>To enhance the experience even more, you can have trained greeters (concierge) to welcome and screen people as they come in. You can even dedicate a priority area where clients have the opportunity to identify their needs or constraints to reduce their wait time to speak with a service agent.</p>
                <p>Someone with a pain-related disability may not have much time or concentration to search for forms or contact information. They need to feel confident that they can complete their tasks. For someone with dexterity issues, holding a pen might be difficult. In this case, service agents should also be authorized to fill out a form on behalf of the client and provide a signature guide to assist in signing documents. Clients may also need ergonomic or specially designed keyboard or mouse such as on-screen keyboard with trackball, joysticks, or other pointing devices.</p>
                <section>

                <h3>Someone living with mental-health challenges</h3>
                <p>While mental health is rapidly becoming more understood by the general public, it is still a stigmatized condition. Persons living with mental health conditions face attitudinal barriers daily; in most cases, mental health issues are entirely invisible. However, when symptoms are apparent, persons may be judged harshly, making the situation even worse. Insensitivity and judgmental behaviour can be upsetting and may be a trigger for escalated behaviour.</p>
                <p>Service by phone can be disorientating or confusing due to difficulty with focusing. Interactive voice response (IVR) calls can be very difficult to go through because of the series of options. Memory or comprehension challenges can sometimes force a person to hang up. Having the option of "press 0" to speak directly with an agent can be very helpful.</p>
                <p>This client group can have a hard time accessing online services. Web designs should consider how the information is displayed and show clear information pathways (i.e. breaking down steps in the application process). Online application forms should not be time-bound. It should allow clients to save and continue at a later time should they need a break. Long periods of focus causes fatigue, which is worsened by noisy environments. Also, when websites are not in plain language or not using simple infographics to convey information, it can become overwhelming.</p>

                <h3>Someone living with a cognitive disability</h3>
                <p>A cognitive disability is described as a limitation affecting the brain or intellectual capacity, as well as learning abilities. It may be a result of a genetic condition, brain injury or degenerative disease such as Alzheimer&rsquo;s or Dementia. It relates to perception, attention, memory, motor skills, language or visual processing when trying to understand information, beginning or completing a task, remembering things or making decisions.</p>
                <p>Clients may demonstrate a reduced ability to understand new or complex information, to learn new skills, and to do things on their own. One thing to keep in mind is some of these individuals do not recognize themselves as having functional limitations, for instance those with Down's Syndrome, Autism or Cerebral Palsy. In other cases, learning disabilities are not apparent unless the client discloses their disability. For example, people living with Dyslexia or Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).</p>
                <p>There is a preference for going in-person to receive service. In fact, within the smaller communities, service agents get to know the person and it makes it easier to adapt to their specific needs and preferences. However, in other instances, attitudinal barriers can be present. For example, when a person&rsquo;s legal capacity is questioned, it may lead to a frustrating service experience and exclusion. Policies and practices need to be examined to ensure full and equitable participation in society and access to services. For example, service agents should be given the authorities to fill out forms on behalf of the client.</p>
                <p>Some symptoms may be amplified as a result of the physical environment. Bright lights, loud noises or crowded areas may trigger challenges. During face-to-face interactions, clients may be accompanied by another person, may require text to be explained, and may need additional reminders of small details. They may not be able to self-serve, but may be reluctant to tell they can&rsquo;t. Specific training for staff may help reassure and support clients with learning disabilities. For example, service agents should be able to offer assistance when the client is filling out a form, and assess if they are eligible for other benefits.</p>
                <p>Phone service may limit the ability to communicate needs and may be overwhelming, or be difficult to understand. Clients may become easily distracted and have difficulty focusing on multiple tasks. They may also experience difficulties hearing verbal instructions or questions if there are other noises in the room. Interactive voice response (IVR) calls can be very difficult to go through when the series of options is lengthy. Memory or comprehension challenges can sometimes force a person to hang up. Having the option of "press 0" to speak directly with an agent can be very helpful.</p>
                <p>This client group can have a hard time accessing online services. Web designers should consider how the information is displayed and be able to show clear information pathways such as breaking down steps in the application process. Online application forms should not be time-bound to allow clients to save and continue at a later time. Pictures, scrolling images and color contrast can be particularly difficult to navigate. Keep navigation consistent from page to page and ensure the user knows what to expect. You can also include information in other formats such as videos or images to assist those who may have trouble understanding words and sentences or require more time to read. In this case, specialized fonts or text to speech reader capabilities can be very helpful.</p>

                <h3>Someone living with a condition affecting speech and language or communication</h3>
                <p>On a daily basis, this client group faces significant attitudinal barriers. There is often judgement towards someone who has difficulty communicating their needs. For example, the client may have difficulty speaking or have a slurred speech.</p>
                <p>In society, these people are under-represented at forums and public consultations. Communication devices such as voice amplification devices, tablets and smart phones can often be helpful.</p>
                <p>They often have their own diverse way of communicating, which might include Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) methods such as gestures, pictures, letter boards and communication devices. Awareness of these methods in service delivery would go a long way in reducing the attitudinal barriers.</p>
                <p>Issues with service on the phone are most prominent for this client group. Misunderstanding the client&rsquo;s situation can lead to attitudinal barriers. For instance, misunderstanding slurred speech as a result of a stroke can be perceived by someone on the phone as someone being drunk. Others may stutter and have longer pauses or making sounds when speaking. This is often mistaken for a prank call.</p>
                <p>As Stephen Hawking, a person with a communication disability, once said &laquo; we have a moral duty to remove the barriers to participation, and to invest sufficient funding and expertise to unlock the vast potential of people with disabilities &raquo;.</p>

                <h3>Someone living with a condition affecting hearing</h3>
                <p>Every day, people who are deaf may face negative perception, beliefs and behaviours regarding their capability. Many people assume that culturally, this client group understands written English or French. However, grammatical rules in sign language are different than the ones used in French or English.</p>
                <p>Office design must consider the struggles that hard of hearing clients experience in large spaces. Glass partitions, background noise and room design contribute to challenge. Counter loops for clients using hearing aids can reduce background noise and facilitate client interactions.</p>
                <p>There is generally a need for training to address the needs of Deaf and hard of hearing individuals. Video remote interpreting services can be beneficial for clients who use sign language to communicate and would allow for equal access. For example, often these clients are required to book an in-person interpreter, leaving some of them without access to the services they need right away. Ideally, it would provide real-time interpreter.</p>
                <p>Many systemic barriers exist for this client group. On the phone, call trees are challenging for Deaf or hard of hearing individuals. Having the option of "press 0" to speak directly with an agent is always preferred. TTY (Text Telephone or TDD, Telecommunication Device for the Deaf) calls are perceived to be rarely answered with the same frequency as regular calls.</p>
                <p>For a person that is hard of hearing, media players can help display captions and provide options to adjust the text size and colour of captions.</p>
                <p>Improvements need to benefit all and not create barriers for others. For example, quick bright flashes are a good way to signal to those with hearing limitations but it has to have the right frequency that does not cause seizures for someone else.</p>

                <h3>Someone living with a condition affecting vision</h3>
                <p>Not all who live with vision impairments are completely blind. Some may be partially sighted or have specific restrictions such as tunnel vision. Others might not be able differentiate between darkness and light. Many issues are encountered by persons living with a visual impairment occur when they navigates an unknown space.</p>
                <p>In-person facilities need to have points of visual definition so that persons with visual limitations can navigate the space. For example, large glass doors should have a high contrast vertical strip. Tactile markings are helpful when the path is properly indicated. Tactile markings in floors should start from the street and lead to the point of entry.</p>
                <p>Persons with visual impairments or other sight-related disabilities benefit from high colour contrast signage at universal height. This means that the sign should be relatively near everyone&rsquo;s eye level. The placement is key when considering clients with tunnel vision, who may need to be relatively close to a sign to be able to read it. Signs also need to be in other physical form such as Braille, embossed/tactile high contrast numbers or letters.</p>
                <p>Any queuing display systems need to be in high contrast colours and avoid using red dots. Wayfinding systems that use beacon technologies can further help clients find their way to an office. This works with Bluetooth and in collaboration with a client&rsquo;s mobile device. It provides real-time navigation information and sends a signal (when the app is downloaded). The instructions are read out loud and allow the client to navigate the space independently.</p>
                <p>Since there are many beacon systems that exists, make sure clients are aware of the one you have in place. By doing so, clients can easily switch between the various phone applications and have the right assistance to get to the service counter. Security systems and all types of communication should be heard and seen. This is important for those who get information primarily by hearing. This includes alerts for emergencies, safety, security, and general announcements.</p>
                <p>Most people with vision or print restrictions benefit from alternate formats that provides access to visual media and announcements. Multiple formats should include: accessible PDF, Braille, large print, audio cassette, computer diskette or CD-Rom, magnifiers and e-text. For example, emails versus mail will allow clients to use text-to-speech technologies.</p>

                    <h4>Recruitment of persons with disabilities</h4>
                    <p>When you conduct research and user testing (UX), partner with organizations that can introduce you to people with disabilities willing to participate and offer feedback. You will then discover insights you won&rsquo;t gain from reading accessibility standards documentation &mdash; like how to create a great client experience (CX) for anyone with permanent, situational, or temporary physical or cognitive challenges.</p>
                    <p>The approach you use to recruit user testers will exclude some profiles so use multiple approaches to ensure diversity. While many individuals have a disability, each disability is different so be careful not to dismiss outliers in the data as errors or 'white noise'. It might be a person with a disability giving you feedback about what doesn&rsquo;t work.</p>

                <p>To do so, you need to understand your clients and listen to what they have to say. After all, you are creating the experience for them - It should reflect the diversity of people who use your service.</p>
                <p>Bring together multiple sources of client insights. This puts you in a great position to help support decision-making and create meaningful experiences that are easy, effective and for clients of all abilities.</p>

                    <li>Review your current methods to ensure clients are reachable.</li>
                    <li>Ensure your co-design process are truly accessible.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Use innovative tools such as journey mapping to help you identify the service barriers that are present across your channels and validate potential accessibility solutions.</p>
                <p>Find out if your program or service is fully accessible. Conduct an early assessment of your accessibility features and evaluate whether or not you meet the needs of people with a wider range of abilities.</p>

                <h3>Inclusion Principal: Universal Design</h3>
                <p>Universal design is an approach to intentionally design and deliver programs and services without creating barriers. While it helps ensure inclusion of persons with disabilities, it is seen as good design practice that meets the needs of anyone who needs to access your programs and services.</p>
                <section>
                    <h4>Universal design is based on 7 principles<sup id="ftnref1"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#ftn1"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>1</a></sup></h4>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong> Equitable use. </strong>Offer the same service and information where possible and where this is not possible, ensure equivalent access. For example, someone who needs more time to process or remember information, make it so online application forms have no time limits to allow for breaks, a longer pause, or recovery at a later date with a save for later option.&nbsp;</li>
                        <li><strong> Flexibility in use. </strong>Provide clients with various options in how they would like to use the program or service. For example, establish different ways for clients to provide feedback, complaints, and suggestions across all of your channels such as an online form, in writing or over the phone using a relay service, if required.</li>
                        <li><strong> Simple and intuitive to use. </strong>Reduce complexity and ensure it is easy to accommodate the various literacy and language skills. For example, provide signage at every point of access and in alternative formats such as the use of wayfinder beacons, content in braille or large print to reduce anxiety and confusion.</li>
                        <li><strong> Perceptible information. </strong>Information is communicated effectively regardless of the client&rsquo;s ability. For example, support media players that display captions and provide audio options with adjustable size and colour for someone that is deaf or has low vision.</li>
                        <li><strong> Tolerance for error. </strong>Encourages design to minimize hazards and poor outcomes or accidental or unintended actions. For example, display furniture to ensure that no object is obstructing and avoid people tripping or falling over chairs that are misplaced.</li>
                        <li><strong> Low physical effort. </strong>Design does not require undue effort and can be used efficiently. For example, conduct a daily accessibility assessment of your service area&nbsp;such as take notice of building or city renovations that are underway or test functionality of door openers.</li>
                        <li><strong> Size and space for approach and use.</strong> Provide enough space for people standing and seating while they are using an assistive device. For example, have multi-level service counters to accommodate wheelchairs or give the ability to someone with physical limitations to utilize as a supported piece of equipment.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <div class="ceasc-quote billy">
                        <p>Inclusive design is everyone&rsquo;s responsibility. Don't be reluctant to connect with people such as subject matter experts, policy makers, designers and front-line staff.</p>

                <h3>Leave no one behind</h3>
                <p>Services are often designed and delivered in ways that create obstacles for persons needing the service. Clients often face multiple barriers and a single barrier can be enough to keep an individual from accessing service &ndash; even if a service is &ldquo;technically accessible&rdquo; by meeting existing standards&hellip; Always ask yourself if your client is actually able to access the service.</p>
                <p>For example, if you only target &ldquo;mainstream&rdquo; clients, you will probably end up forgetting about the deaf community or the ones visually impaired and how they will become aware of your program. Think about how an individual with diminished memory will collect information about your program for when they need it.</p>
                <section>
                    <h4>Intersectionality</h4>
                    <p>To be truly inclusive, you need to think of your clients as complete human beings. A person with disability is more than just their disability. Everyone has multiple characteristics that we need to keep in mind.</p>
                    <p>Intersectionality is about a diversity of characteristics for which society, or your organization has created barriers that prevent some individuals from accessing services. Find out what characteristics are likely to be seen among your clients.</p>
                    <p>Always work toward finding out who are the remaining individuals not accessing your service. For programs that include people in vulnerable situations, it is unlikely that it is random individuals willingly choosing to opt out &ndash; and a small percentage of a large program is still a lot of clients. It may be those most in need that are missing out on the program intended to help them.</p>
                    <p>Although this playbook is focused on people with disabilities, here are other client demographics that can be intersecting, creating unique considerations for your service delivery:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Indigenous Peoples </strong>&ndash; In 2017, 32% of First Nations people living off reserve, 30% of M&eacute;tis and 19% of Inuit had one or more disabilities that limited them in their daily activities.<sup id="ftnref2"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#ftn2"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>2</a></sup> This intersects with considerations specific to this community, such as: location, language, historical relationship with the government. Many remote, on-reserve communities do not have paved roads, easy internet access (satellite only, for example), fly-in only communities.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Poverty &ndash; living in poverty implies the individual is in a more precarious situation meaning that service delivery problems can have more dramatic impacts on outcomes.</li>
                        <li>Youth &ndash; mental health-related disabilities are the most prevalent type of disability: 8% of Canadians between age 15 and 24 years.<sup id="ftnref3-1"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#ftn3"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>3</a></sup></li>
                        <li>Seniors &ndash; almost half (47%) of seniors over age 75 report have a disability. Dexterity, hearing and physical disabilities increase significantly with age. <sup id="ftnref3-2"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#ftn3"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>3</a></sup></li>
                        <li>LGBTQ2+ &ndash; In addition to the challenges created by society at large, transgender persons may have increased need to deal with government while transitioning genders, which may coincide with temporary disabilities.</li>
                        <li>Victims of violence &ndash; survivors of domestic violence have a significantly higher likelihood of brain-related injuries, such as concussions.</li>
                        <li>People living in rural and remote locations</li>
                        <li>People who are incarcerated and/or previously incarcerated</li>
                        <li>Visible minority groups</li>
                        <li>Newcomers</li>
                        <li>Women &ndash; 24% of women are more likely to have a disability than men (20%).<sup id="ftnref3-3"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#ftn3"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>3</a></sup></li>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </section>

                <h3>Good decisions that create a positive experience</h3>
                <p>Inclusive design aims to remove the service barriers that affects your client's ability to obtain the services to which they are entitled.</p>
                <p>When you develop services, each decision can limit the accessibility of the service. Few policy objectives start out inaccessible; they become less accessible as you make decisions about applications, reporting, interacting, etc.. Some of those decisions may be necessary, perhaps for integrity, but has every alternative really been considered?</p>
                <p>After exploring all alternatives, the remaining barriers can be examined to determine how to get around them when they affect someone's ability to access the service. Service design needs to be proactive in finding solutions before the barrier affects a client.</p>
                <p>Government uses multiple channels to deliver programs and services. These mainly include<strong> in-person</strong>, <strong>phone</strong> and <strong>online</strong>. No one channel is accessible for everyone hence alternative approaches are key to inclusion.</p>
                <section>
                    <h4>Curb cut effect</h4>
                    <p>While accessibility focuses on key considerations for persons with disabilities, inclusive design considers from the start, how something might be easy and useful for as many people as possible. One example is the curb cut effect &ndash; a term used to describe what happens when an accessibility feature benefits more people than the group it was originally intended for, such as a ramp or path for wheelchair users. This also benefit parents pushing strollers, users of walking aids or people carrying heavy packages.</p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h4>Everyone is unique</h4>
                    <p>Experiences of disability vary. Some disabilities are considered mild, and some more severe. Some are progressive, some fluctuate, and some are stable. Some individuals are born with a disability, and many develop them later in life. 71% of persons with disabilities have more than one type of disability, and so may experience a variety of disability experiences. All individuals with disabilities need to have access to services.</p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h4>It&rsquo;s about the person</h4>
                    <p>What a client could or could not do last time is not what they can do this time. Approximately 60% of persons with disabilities have conditions that are changing over time (progressive, recurrent, fluctuating). Clients need to be able to decide how they want to access services, every time.</p>
                    <p>As a service provider, service design should not assume that a family member or personal care giver will perform tasks on behalf of someone living with a type of disability or functional limitations. Their personal information deserves privacy. Persons with disabilities are like everyone else, they have the right to access information and services themselves.</p>

It has also presented substantial challenges for persons with disabilities in the way they access services. <strong>During these times, the </strong><strong>Government must ensure that Canadians with disabilities maintain their health, safety and dignity</strong>.</p>

                <h3>Use plain language</h3>
                <p>To communicate in plain language doesn't mean over-simplifying or leaving out critical information. When you use plain language, it actually makes critical information accessible and understandable for everyone.</p>
                <p>When you write and speak plainly and simply, you:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>increase the chances that people will find, read and understand your information from any device</li>
                    <li>make your information more accessible to people with disabilities</li>
                    <li>allow people who are reading your information on a small screen to see essential information first</li>
                    <li>save resources when editing and translating your text</li>
                    <li>improve task completion and cut costs by, for example, reducing enquiries</li>
                </ul>
                <p>When communicating with clients, communications products and activities must be accurate, organized and accessible. Be simple, clear and concise with your key messages, services and storyline. Use language that is easy to read and understand, and include common language, images and similar references across all products and channels.</p>
                <p>Always check the reading level of your text. Readability tools help you check if content is too wordy or complex. When content is at a reading level above grade 8, it can become difficult for many people to understand or complete their task.</p>
                <p>Is your Web&nbsp;really accessible? Progress is being made on the&nbsp;technical aspects of accessible web&nbsp;standards&nbsp;but plain language is&nbsp;an often overlooked part of that standard.</p>

                <h3>Interact respectfully with someone who uses a service animal</h3>
                <p>A service animal is any guide dog, signal dog or other animal individually trained to assist a person with a disability. Each animal is trained to perform various tasks and provide a range of services.</p>
                <p>A service animal is not a pet. It should be treated like an extension of their owner&rsquo;s arm. The rules and licensing for service animals are different for each province, many do not issue permits or regulate the training of animals.</p>
                <section>
                    <h4>Best practices with someone who uses a service animal</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Do not request that the owner leaves the animal in different location, such as outside of your office or classroom.</li>
                        <li>Avoid petting or talking to a service animal: this distracts the animal from its tasks.</li>
                        <li>Do not feed or offer treats to the animal.</li>
                        <li>Avoid deliberately startling the animal.&nbsp;</li>
                        <li>Remember not all service animals wear special collars or harnesses. If you are not sure and it is necessary that you verify, it is okay to ask the owner if it is a service animal.&nbsp;</li>
                        <li>Remember that the owner is responsible for maintaining control over the animal at all time. You are not responsible for cleaning up after it or feeding it. You may provide water if the owner requests it.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Dogs are by far the most common type of animal used to assist people with visual impairments. However, many different types of animals can be used and assist other types of disabilities:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>A guide dog</strong> serves as a travel aid for a person with vision loss.</li>
                        <li><strong>A hearing or signal animal</strong> alerts a person with hearing loss when a sound occurs, such as knock on the door or alarm.</li>
                        <li><strong>Mobility assistance animals</strong> may carry, fetch, open doors, ring doorbells, activate elevator buttons, pull a wheelchair, steady a person while walking or help someone get up after a fall.</li>
                        <li><strong>A seizure response animal</strong> warns a person of an impending seizure or provides aid during a seizure such as going for help or standing guard over the person.</li>
                        <li><strong>Therapeutic assistance animals</strong> aid people with cognitive or psychological disabilities by bringing a phone to the person in emergency, turning on the lights, fetching medication, barking for help in emergency or assisting a person with panic disorder coping in crowds.</li>
                    </ul>

                <section>
                    <h4>Culture is a thing</h4>
                    <p>Culture is reflected in the attitudes and behaviours within the organization and determines what is encouraged or discouraged. Employees face implicit expectations that will affect the decisions they make each day as part of their work. This can be seen in many aspects of your day-to-day activities.</p>
                    <p>For example, the priority you place on ensuring systems are accessible, how you allocate resources and investments and the way people with disabilities are treated each day is a reflection of your culture.</p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h4>Why culture matters for service delivery</h4>
                    <p>There is a saying that &ldquo;culture eats strategy for breakfast&rdquo;&hellip; will your strategy to improve the accessibility of client services survive the ingrained attitudes and behaviours of your organization?</p>
                    <p>Organizations cannot develop procedures for every possibility, at some point client service staff will need to adapt. How they adapt will be guided by the organization&rsquo;s culture. Over time culture will counter the best intentions as it is encompassed in the beliefs and behaviours&nbsp;of employees.</p>
                    <p>Legacy policies and procedures can create hurdles for staff wanting to ensure a person with a disability can access a service of benefit. An organization&rsquo;s policies indicate expectations that can re-enforce an outdated culture. A renewed focus on accessibility needs to be holistic.</p>

                        <li>Is accessibility considered from the start when developing a new program or service?</li>
                        <li>Is compliance to accessibility standards part of your department&rsquo;s go/no go decision for launching new systems or services?</li>
                        <li>Do all staff receive training to improve their understanding of accessibility issues?</li>
                        <li>Do employees talk about accessibility just because it is important?</li>

                <h3>Take steps to move your culture towards accessibility</h3>
                <section>
                    <h4>Express your values</h4>
                    <p>Values are statements about how we would like staff to think and behave. They reflect what we want our organization to be. When values and culture align, it is a powerful force moving the organization forward.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;The Government of Canada&rsquo;s Values and Ethics Code explicitly identifies Respect for People as a Value of the Public Service.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Persons with disabilities are explicitly included in the Canadians Human Rights Act.</li>
                        <li>The Accessible Canada Act establishes principles that apply to federal organizations.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Accessibility is part of your values; how do you express your values to highlight the importance of accessibility?</p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h4>Embed accessibility in governance</h4>
                    <p>Service delivery infrastructure is often the result of many separate projects implemented over time and continues to evolve into the future. Hence, accessibility isn&rsquo;t a one time question and ensuring services remain accessible can benefit from governance processes.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Is there a clear understanding of the accessibility standards for the organization? Do exceptions require an explicit decision?</li>
                        <li>Is accessibility a mandatory requirement for investment approval and implementation?</li>
                        <li>Is there explicit tracking and reporting on progress towards accessibility?</li>
                        <li>Is it clear who is accountable for accessibility?</li>
                    </ul>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h4>Awareness and understanding</h4>
                    <p>Society&rsquo;s understanding of accessibility has evolved significantly and most people don&rsquo;t have the opportunity to see it in its entirety through personal experience. Awareness and understanding is a key element of changing culture.</p>
                    <p>While specialists will need specific training to inform their work (e.g., service specialist, web designer, etc.), it is the raising of the collective understanding and awareness that changes culture. Training, information, regular discussions can all work to develop awareness of the barriers that exist for persons with disabilities.</p>
                    <p><strong>Respect for People</strong></p>
                    <blockquote class="ceasc-cite">
                        <p>Treating all people with respect, dignity and fairness is fundamental to creating relationship with the Canadian public and contributes to a safe and healthy work environment that promotes engagement, openness and transparency.</p>
