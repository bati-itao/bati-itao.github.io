							As our Canadian society becomes more aware of neurodiversity, workplaces are constantly improving and looking for new ways on creating a welcoming and inclusive environment for all, including employees who have different ways of thinking, perceiving, and learning.  
						</p>
						<p>
							Accessibility Tools and Adaptive Technology are the one solution that can improve productivity, job satisfaction, and overall wellbeing of neurodiverse employees. They are designed to help remove barriers to the people with disabilities to perform tasks that might otherwise be challenging. 
						</p>
						<p>
							There are great tools available in Microsoft 365 (M365) for people with dyslexia, seizures, autism, ADHD, and other cognitive disabilities.

							The use of Adaptive Technology (AT) in the workplace plays a key role in empowering people with disabilities, showing that it is supportive of the workforce's accessibility needs. The various adaptive technologies available can help remove accessibility barriers and provide support at work for neurodiverse employees.
						</p>
						<p>
							There are common Adaptive Technologies (AT) for employees with cognitive, dexterity or mobility disabilities available at ESDC such as: 
						</p>

						<h2>Cognitive AT</h2>
						<p>
							WordQ Pro, Kurzweil 3000, Echo Smart Pen, Symphony Smartpen and Livescribe+, Office 365 features (Read Aloud and dictate), Windows desktop configuration (Night light, contrast, font, etc.).
						</p>

						<h2>Dexterity and or Mobility AT</h2>
						<p>
							Dragon Naturally Speaking, Dragon Medical Practice, Work Rave, PC Eye Tracker, TrackerPro2 camera, Programmable X-keys, pedals, and buttons, AMAneo USB, Anti-tremor devices, Ergonomic mice, keyboard recommendations and much more.
						</p>

						<h2>Loan Bank service at ESDC</h2>

						<p>
							Part of ESDC's IT Accessibility Office, the Accessibility Center of Excellence (ACE) maintains, reviews, and procures adaptive technology for short-term loans to employees. Items loaned are evaluated to determine if they are useful to individuals with common disability types such as cognitive, mobility or dexterity impairments. By developing a strategy suited to everyone's needs, the ACE team can help to determine the best adaptive technology made available for client use. 
						</p>
						<p>
							To access this service for either yourself or for one of your employees, please submit a service request either by filling out this <a href="https://a11yrmt.ca/newrequest-en.php">Intake Form</a>, by sending an inquiry to the <a href="mailto:edsc.ti-it.a11y.esdc@hrsdc-rhdcc.gc.ca">ITAO GD mailbox</a> or by opening a ticket through the <a href="http://NSD.prv">National Service Desk.</a>

						<h2>How can employers embrace Neurodiversity in the workplace?</h2>

						<ul>
							<li>
								<strong>Creating an inclusive workplace culture:</strong> Ensuring the culture of inclusivity, acceptance, and respect for all employees. This can be done by promoting an environment that values diversity and encourages open communication.
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>Offer accommodations:</strong> Accommodations that enable neurodiverse employees to work to the best of their abilities. These can include flexibility in work arrangements, assistive technology, soft lighting, or tools that can help employees carry out their work better.
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>Raise awareness and promote a diverse workforce:</strong> Employers can offer training and support for managers and co-workers to raise awareness about neurodivergent conditions. Through this, employees can feel more comfortable to discuss their neurodiversity.
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>Inclusive Hiring Process:</strong> Employers can accommodate neurodivergent employees by implementing more inclusive hiring methods. They should also foster a positive work environment that embraces employees with neurological differences to reach their full potential such as:
								<ul>
									<li>
										providing interview questions in advance.
									</li>
									<li>
										multiple options for participating in an interview (e.g., in person, virtually, over the phone, over e-mail).
									</li>
									<li>
										avoiding abstract and behavioural questions.
									</li>
									<li>
										focusing on skill match rather than a personality match.
									</li>
									<li>
										providing job seekers with hands-on opportunities to demonstrate their skills.
									</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
						</ul>
