        <p>Neurodivergent individuals, including those with Attention-Deficit (Hyperactivity) Disorder (ADD, ADHD), autism, epilepsy, or dyslexia often face challenges with attention, information processing, and reading.</p>

        <p>Did you know that<strong> PowerPoint offers features that can help you design with neurodiversity in mind?</strong> If you would like more information, don’t miss the <a href="https://esdc.sabacloud.com/Saba/Web_spf/CA1PRD0006/app/me/learningeventdetail/cours000000000134950">Best Practices for PowerPoint Accessibility</a> session on <strong>March 13, 2025.</strong></p>

        <h2>March ITAO PowerPoint Spotlight - The Outline View</h2>

        <p>When creating content, it is important to consider neurodiversity to ensure that all audience members can effectively process and engage with your content. The Outline View feature provides a text-based view of your slides, rather than the design. Why is this important for neurodivergent individuals?  </p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>The outline view creates a <strong>hierarchical structure</strong> that organizes information clearly and logically, <strong>offering a clear roadmap</strong> so that individuals can easily navigate between sections. This improves focus for those who may struggle otherwise.</li>
            <li>By <strong>eliminating visual distractions</strong> like background images, animations, and complex formatting, this feature reduces cognitive load, allowing individuals to focus on the main content without feeling overwhelmed.</li>
            <li>It helps <strong>individuals who rely on adaptive technologies</strong> to read and understand the content more easily.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><span style="color: orange;">Give it a try!</span> Adjust your design with the Outline View by going to the <strong>View tab</strong> and selecting <strong>Outline View</strong> to see the slide content. </p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Review each slide</strong> – Are the main points visible in the outline? Is any text missing from the slide? Do all slides have unique titles?</li>
            <li><strong>Missing text?</strong> – If some text does not appear, you may be using the wrong type of content box. Adjust it to ensure that all text is properly displayed in the outline.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><span style="color: orange;">Important!</span> Text boxes are not visible in the <strong>Outline View</strong> pane; content placeholders must be used. </p>

        <p>If you need to add content placeholders instead of text boxes, see how to <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/add-edit-or-remove-a-placeholder-on-a-slide-layout-a8d93d28-66cb-43fd-9f9d-e12d0a7a1f06">add, edit, or remove a placeholder on a slide layout.</a></p>

        <p><span style="color: orange;">Tip:</span> Copying and pasting placeholders or adding text boxes creates barriers, as the text will not appear in the <strong>Outline View</strong> and could be missed by adaptive technologies.</p>

        <p>The Outline View in PowerPoint is especially important for neurodivergent individuals because it does the following:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Reduces cognitive load</strong> – Seeing all slide content in a structured text format helps process information without the distraction of design elements.</li>
            <li><strong>Improves organization</strong> – It ensures a clear, logical flow of ideas, making it easier to structure presentations effectively.</li>
            <li><strong>Enhances focus</strong> – For those with ADHD, dyslexia, or executive function challenges, the Outline View minimizes visual clutter and allows them to focus on content rather than formatting.</li>
            <li><strong>Facilitates editing</strong> – It allows presenters to quickly spot missing or redundant information without flipping through slides one by one.</li>
            <li><strong>Provides better accessibility</strong> – It ensures that the text is readable, that titles are unique, and that key points are clear, which are essential elements for both presenters and audiences with neurodivergent needs.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Incorporating the Outline View into your PowerPoint workflow may <strong>seem like a small change, but it can make a big impact.</strong> By creating a more structured, predictable, and sensory-friendly presentation, neurodivergent individuals can process and retain information more effectively. These simple adjustments not only improve clarity and organization, they foster a more inclusive environment where everyone can engage with the content more comfortably and efficiently. </p>
