            <p>When it comes to ensuring accessible IT solutions, the IT Accessibility Office’s (ITAO) Accessibility Service Management and Accessibility Audit teams play a crucial role in guiding the way. You can think of them as experts in accessibility who are there to help you ensure that your digital solutions are inclusive for all.</p>

        <h2>Building Accessible Strategies for All</h2>

            <p>The Accessibility Service Management Team is committed to helping other teams ensure that their IT strategies and tools are inclusive. By collaborating with stakeholders and working across teams, they help to integrate accessibility into everyday processes.</p>

            <p>They provide a range of services, such as:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Recommendations, advice, and coaching to help design IT solutions that are accessible and effective for everyone.</li>
                <li>Early guidance to address accessibility challenges before they become roadblocks, saving both time and resources.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Put simply, the Accessibility Service Management Team is there to support the organization’s overall efforts in creating accessible solutions.</p>

        <h2>Breaking Down Barriers with Accessibility Audits</h2>

            <p>You’ve probably heard of “audits,” but did you know that they can be used to make things more accessible? Think of an accessibility audit like a check-up for your digital content! It’s all about making sure your websites, applications, presentations, and documents are accessible, barrier-free, and easy to use for everyone.</p>

            <p>Our accessibility auditors use a variety of specialized tools to spot any digital hiccups. These tools scan your content for common accessibility issues and point out areas that need a little TLC. Some of the key tools they use include:</p>
        
            <ul>
                <li>Accessibility Insights</li>
                <li>WAVE</li>
                <li>axe DevTools</li>
                <li>W3C HTML and CSS Validator</li>
                <li>Colour Contrast Analyzer</li>
                <li>Stylus and Web Developer Browser Extension</li>
            </ul>

            <p>But wait—there’s more! They also test content using specialized keyboards and assistive technology in order to understand how people with diverse needs interact with your content. Together, these tools help them perform a thorough audit, ensuring that everything is up to standard. The results of these audits help to improve the user experience and create a more inclusive digital space for everyone, all while keeping things legally compliant, too!</p>

        <h2>IT Accessibility – A Smarter, More Inclusive Way to Work!</h2>

            <p>Making your content accessible is not about adding an extra step. Implementing accessible design strategies from the beginning and performing regular accessibility audits will help you identify issues early on. This will ultimately save you time, minimize delays, and help to ensure that everyone has equal access to the digital world.</p>
