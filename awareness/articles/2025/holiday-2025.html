        <p>As we toast to new beginnings, let’s commit to making digital accessibility a priority — because inclusion is <strong>always in season</strong>.</p>

        <p>Let’s celebrate the holiday season by wrapping our digital spaces with care, clarity, and inclusion. Whether you're sending festive e-cards, hosting virtual celebrations, or setting your out-of-office message, every detail counts when it comes to accessibility.</p>

        <p>Here are a few joyful ways to make your digital communications more welcoming for everyone:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Let Your Visuals Shine Bright</strong><br> 
                When sharing digital visual like banners, e-cards, or images, don’t forget to add alt text. It ensures that everyone—including those who use adaptive technology—can enjoy the spirit, story, and message behind your visuals.<br>
                Want to make your visuals more accessible? Check out the IT Accessibility Office (ITAO) article on how to <a href="https://bati-itao.github.io/awareness/articles/2025/non-text-content-alternative-text.html">Give Non-text Content a Voice Using Alternative Text</a>.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Wrap Your Digital Gift in Beautiful Readable Colours</strong><br>
                Choose bright, high-contrast colours to make your visuals pop and your messages clear. Use a colour contrast analyzer to verify readability. You can find one in the <a href="http://srmis-sigdi-iagent.prv/AppPortal/en/Home/Index/2">Application Catalogue</a> or by submitting a request through the <a href="https://iservice.prv/eng/imit/nsd/index.shtml">National Service Desk</a>.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Lights, Camera, Inclusion!</strong><br>
                Whether you’re sharing a video or hosting virtual meetings or celebrations, always include captions and transcripts. This minor detail makes your heartfelt messages accessible to all, including those with diverse needs.<br>
                Refer to the ITAO article on how to <a href="https://bati-itao.github.io/awareness/articles/2025/inclusive-videos.html">Make Your Videos Inclusive with Transcripts and Captions in Microsoft Stream</a>.
            </li>
            <!--<li><strong>Font-tastic Finishing Touches</strong><br>
                When dressing up your digital messages, don’t forget to choose fonts that everyone can enjoy. Use easy-to-read fonts like <strong>Arial, Aptos, or Calibri</strong>, with <strong>12-point size</strong>, and <strong>1.5 line spacing</strong> for optimal readability.
            </li>-->
            <li><strong>Holiday Away Message</strong><br>
                A colleague, client, or peer may want to stop by to say hello, but you are away. Make sure the holiday out-of-office message on your digital door is accessible, letting everyone know you’re away and when you’ll be back.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Tie a Bow with Language Navigation and the Proofing Language Feature</strong><br>
                Let’s ensure our digital communications reflect joy by offering clear navigation between French and English, and using language proofing tools to keep messages polished and inclusive. That way, everyone can enjoy your message in their <strong>preferred language</strong>.<br>

                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>A Note of Gratitude</strong><br>
                This holiday season, give the gift of accessibility, so that everyone feels that they <strong>belong</strong>. Accessibility opens doors, removes barriers, and invites everyone to participate fully. Let’s keep giving, every day of the year.
            </li>
