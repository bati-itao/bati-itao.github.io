                <p>As a Digital Accessibility Professional within the Information Technology Accessibility Office (ITAO), I often find myself advocating for inclusive design and digital equity everywhere I go. Every now and then, I experience firsthand the very barriers I work to eliminate. A recent incident involving something as simple as a computer mouse reminded me just how important—or frustrating—accessibility can be.</p>

                <h2>The Unexpected Hurdle</h2>

                    <p>It started with a forgotten mouse. I arrived at work ready to dive into my day, only to realize that I’d left my mouse at home. Fortunately, our department recently opened a helpful new service where employees can borrow equipment or get tech support. When I entered the walk-in centre*, I explained my need to borrow equipment to one of the two staff members on site. I was told that they don’t usually loan out mice, but that they happened to have a spare I could borrow for the day. There was just one catch: I could only borrow it after submitting a service request through the National Service Desk’s <a href="http://srmis-sigdi-iagent.prv/en">IT Service Portal! <i class="fas fa-external-link-square-alt"></i><span class="wb-inv">Internal link</span></a></p>

                <h2>Navigating Without a Mouse</h2>

                <p>In my role as an accessibility tester with ITAO, I often try to test everything with a keyboard and take the opportunity to do so even when it isn’t necessarily required for the task at hand. I quickly realized I could simply use my keyboard skills to navigate the site and submit my service request. But what followed was a frustrating reminder that not all digital systems are created equal.</p>

                <div class="container-fluid">
	                <div class="row">
                        <div class="col-md-2">
                            <img alt="" src="images-2025/accessibility_reflexion.png" class="img-responsive" />
                        </div>
                        <div class="col-md-10">
                            <p>Despite my best efforts, using the Tab key to move through the multitude of links and fields took a long time on every page, and I couldn’t remember whether I was supposed to use the spacebar or Enter key to select hyperlinks. When I arrived on the first WebDirect screen, the focus indicator (a requirement to help sighted users see which on-screen element is currently being selected) was barely visible. As someone with a cognitive disability, I could already sense my blood pressure rising. What should have taken two minutes was now stretching into a much longer ordeal, costing me valuable time and productivity.</p>

                </div>

                <h2>The Bigger Picture</h2>

                <p>This experience got me thinking: while less problematic for someone like me, this could well be a daily frustration for persons with a disability. And even though this wasn’t the first time I’d tested something without a mouse, it was frustrating.</p>

                <p>“Accessibility isn’t just about compliance. It’s about dignity, independence, and equal opportunity for everyone.”</p>

                <p>Sometimes frustrations can arise from something as subtle as needing to hit the Enter key to select a button, or from having to tab through a dozen hyperlinks just to bypass a submenu.</p>

                <p>This experience, while minor in the grand scheme of things, underscores a critical point: accessibility isn’t a one-time checkbox—it’s an ongoing commitment. Even well-designed systems can fall short if they’re not tested with real users and assistive technologies. And when they do fall short, the impact is real.</p>
