        <p>Accessibility and security aren’t just checkboxes, they’re what make our digital workplace inclusive and safe for everyone. That’s why the IT Accessibility Office (ITAO) and the Cyber Security Team collaborated to host an event dedicated to strengthening digital accessibility and cybersecurity awareness last month.</p>

        <p>In November 2025, we hosted an <strong>in-person kiosk at 22 Eddy</strong> where employees could drop by to chat with experts and get answers to real-world questions about accessibility and cybersecurity best practices.</p>

        <p>Thank you to our IITB Accessibility Co-Champions, Mathieu Leprohon and Alexandre Singh, as well as Jacob Raffoul, Director General of the Cyber and IT Security Directorate, for taking the time to visit the kiosk and show just how committed they are to building a workplace where everyone can work with confidence.</p>

        <h2>Expanding Access Through Virtual Engagement</h2>

        <p>ITAO hosted its second One-Stop Accessibility Virtual Kiosk on December 4, 2025. This online kiosk gave employees virtual drop- in access to experts, tools,  and tips. Topics covered included:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>How to make documents accessible (e.g. checking colour contrast in digital content)</li>
            <li>Mobility and cognitive support options</li>
            <li>Resources for employees who are hard of hearing</li>
            <li>Adaptive technology support and loan bank services</li>
        </ul>
