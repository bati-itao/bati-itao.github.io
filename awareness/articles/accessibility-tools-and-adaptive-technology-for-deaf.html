							<strong>(Breaking Sound Barriers)</strong></br>
							In today's inclusive work environment, it is important to recognize the needs and abilities of all employees, including those with hearing impairments. They can often face communication challenges, making it essential to provide them with the necessary accessibility tools and adaptive technology to enable full participation in the workplace.
						</p>

						<p>
							According to Statistics Canada, in 2016, 40% of adults aged 20 to 79 had some form of hearing loss, and 78% of adults 60-79 experienced hearing loss.
						</p>

						<p>
							Various accessibility tools are available for Microsoft 365 users to support deaf, deafened, and hard-of-hearing employees enhancing their professional growth and fostering a more inclusive work environment.

						<p>
							The use of Adaptive Technology (AT) in the workplace plays a key role in empowering people with disabilities, showing that it is supportive of the workforce's accessibility needs. The various adaptive technologies available can help remove accessibility barriers and provide support at work for Deaf, deafened and or hard-of-hearing employees.
						</p>
						
						<p>
							Part of ESDC's IT Accessibility Office, the Accessibility Center of Excellence (ACE) maintains, reviews, and procures adaptive technology for short-term loans to employees. Items loaned are evaluated to determine if they are useful to individuals with hearing impairments. By developing a strategy suited to everyone's needs, the ACE team can help determine the best adaptive technology made available for client use.
						</p>
