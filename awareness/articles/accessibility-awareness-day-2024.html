                <p>This year, the thirteenth <a href="https://accessibility.day/">Global Accessibility Awareness Day (GAAD)</a> will be celebrated on May 16, 2024.
                    GAAD serves as a reminder of the ongoing need for inclusive design and accessibility, ensuring that digital platforms, tools, and resources are 
                    accessible to all.</p>

                <p>In the workplace, <strong>digital accessibility</strong> is all about removing barriers and creating equal opportunities for employees to access 
                    information, communicate effectively, collaborate with colleagues, and perform their duties.</p>

                <p>However, <strong>digital inaccessibility</strong> at work:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Hinders performance by making it hard for employees to access information and resources. This can lead to challenges with navigating documents and software applications, affecting the employee’s ability to perform well.</li>
                    <li>Isolates employees with different abilities. For example, without accessibility features like captions, sign language interpretation, or screen reader compatibility, employees’ ability to participate in meetings and collaborate with others is limited. As a result, employees can feel left out and miss important information.</li>
                    <li>Poses barriers to career advancement, skills development, and employment for persons with different abilities. This can be caused by inaccessible training materials or professional development resources.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Breaking the Code - How Digital Accessibility Promises Workplace Success </h2>

                <p>Prioritizing digital accessibility helps employees succeed and breaks down barriers of digital inaccessibility.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Employees can fully access documents, software applications, tools, training, and resources, which contributes to fostering productivity and collaboration.</li>
                    <li>Captioning, sign language interpretation, and screen reader compatibility help bridge the gap between visual content and auditory understanding across communication platforms.</li>
                    <li>Providing assistive tools or adaptive technology enhances productivity and facilitates work for everyone.</li>
                    <li>Providing continuous training, engaging accessibility champions, promoting accessibility awareness on various topics, conducting accessibility audits, and providing ongoing support to employees creates a positive cultural shift towards accessibility in the workplace.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Did you Know?</h2>

                <p>According to <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/accessibility/reports-publications/accessibility-3-year-plan-2022.html">Employment And Social Development Canada (ESDC),3 Years Accessibility Plan</a> to remove accessibility barriers:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>As of 2021, ESDC’s webpages on Canada.ca are easier to understand, they now meet a grade 6 to 8 reading level.</li>
                    <li>The ESDC Accessibility Office (EAO) created an online toolbox of resources for employees on how to write accessible content and how to hold <a href="https://bati-itao.github.io/resources/accessible-meeting-event-guidelines-en.html">accessible meetings and events</a>. The EAO also trained over 700 employees on how to write web content in plain language.</li>
                    <li>In 2023, ESDC updated and promoted the accessibility booklet "<a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/programs/disability/arc/words-images.html">A Way with Words and Images</a>". This guide helps federal employees use appropriate language to communicate effectively about disability in writing, speech, and images.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Adaptive Technologies at ESDC</h2>

                <p>ESDC is committed to promoting best practices in accessibility in all policies, programs, services and workplaces and the 
                    <strong>Accessibility Centre of Excellence (ACE)</strong> part of <a href="https://bati-itao.github.io/index.html">ESDC's IT Accessibility Office</a> maintains, 
                    reviews, and procures adaptive technology to loan to employees. The ACE team can help determine the best adaptive technology available to suit
