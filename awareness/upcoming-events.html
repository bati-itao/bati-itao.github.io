						<h2>November</h2>

					<h3 class="h1">Accessibility Information Booth</h3>
						
						<p>You are warmly invited to attend an in-person accessibility booth hosted by the <strong>IT Accessibility Office (ITAO)</strong>. This initiative aims to foster an inclusive workplace and support the full potential of all employees.</p>

						<p><strong>Date</strong> | November 13, 2025</p>
						<p><strong>Time</strong> | 8:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. (ET)</p> 
						<p><strong>Location</strong> | Lobby of 22 Eddy Street</p>

						<p>This booth is a great opportunity to learn more about the accessibility and accommodation services available through ITAO. Whether you're looking for support with accessible technologies, inclusive digital practices, or workplace accommodations, our team will be on-site to answer your questions and share helpful resources.</p>

						<p>We encourage you to stop by, meet our experts, and explore how we can work together to remove barriers and build a more inclusive work environment.</p>

						<p>Thank you for helping make our organization a place where inclusion and personal growth are central to our values.</p>

					<h4 class="h3">Can’t make it to the in-person kiosk in November? No Problem</h4>
						
						<p>Keep an eye out for the virtual kiosk coming in December, where ITAO’s IT accessibility experts will be online and ready to help. It’s a great opportunity to ask questions, share ideas, and explore how we can work together to remove barriers and build a more inclusive workplace.</p>

						<p>We are happy to assist you with any inquiries you may have. If you require more information about the kiosks, please contact us at <a href="mailto:edsc.ti-it.a11y.esdc@hrsdc-rhdcc.gc.ca">EDSC.TI-IT.A11Y.ESDC@hrsdc-rhdcc.gc.ca</a>.</p>


				<h3 class="h1">Honouring  Indigenous Excellency of All Abilities: Culture, Connection, and Inclusion</h3>

					<p>November is <strong>Indigenous Disability Awareness Month (IDAM)</strong>. This month is about taking the time to recognize and celebrate the experiences, cultures, and strengths of Indigenous people  with disabilities. It also serves as a reminder of the importance of accessibility, as many Indigenous people  with disabilities still experience difficulties when trying to access government funding, programs, and services.</p>

					<p>IDAM is an opportunity to listen, learn, and take action to ensure that the services we provide are inclusive, accessible,  and respectful of Indigenous cultures. With this in mind,  we invite you to join us for an event that <strong>includes storytelling, learning opportunities, and the sharing of real-life experiences</strong>.</p>

					<p><strong>Date</strong> | November 20, 2025</p>
					<p><strong>Register for the Bilingual Session via Saba</strong> | <a href="https://can01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fesdc.sabacloud.com%2FSaba%2FWeb_spf%2FCA1PRD0006%2Fcommon%2Fledetail%2F0000156416&data=05%7C02%7Cricha.sharma%40hrsdc-rhdcc.gc.ca%7Cffa5a611fa1a44756d6c08de068b36c8%7C9ed558468a814246acd8b1a01abfc0d1%7C0%7C0%7C638955392172589222%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=znbTGnM2qGixIgKMiYLShXEL0YK1LgQgPXC2MlNFfbk%3D&reserved=0">Honouring Indigenous Excellency of All Abilities: Culture, Connection, and Inclusion</a></p> 
					<p><strong>Time</strong> | 1:00 p.m. to 2:00 p.m. (ET)</p> 

					<p>During this event, you’ll hear from Indigenous voices and learn about the barriers they face as well as what we can do to help address them. As  public servants, we all have a role to play in creating workplaces that are inclusive, respectful, and meaningfully engaged in the reconciliation process.</p>

					<p><strong>Together, let’s celebrate strength, break down barriers, and work towards a more inclusive future.</strong></p>

					<p>If you have any questions or require accommodations, please contact the Outreach, Communications and Support Team at <a href="mailto:EDSC.TI.SENSIBILISATION-AWARENESS.IT.ESDC@hrsdc-rhdcc.gc.ca">EDSC.TI.SENSIBILISATION-AWARENESS.IT.ESDC@hrsdc-rhdcc.gc.ca</a>.</p>
