    <p>As Deputy Minister Champion for Federal Employees with Disabilities, I have the privilege of working in support
      of building a more accessible public service that is grounded in public service values and ethics. The commitment
      to public service by federal employees with disabilities is powerful and motivating. We benefit from their
      incredible talents that are applied daily to the benefit of all Canadians. </p>

    <p>I am grateful every time an employee with a disability places their trust in me and shares their story. These
      stories can be difficult to listen to because they involve deeply personal experiences. They also highlight that
      while the federal public service has made substantial progress on accessibility and disability inclusion, there is
      more to do. </p>

    <p>Since being named Champion in November 2022, the most frequent concern brought to my attention is how we
      accommodate employees. Many of our colleagues have shared how departmental approaches to accommodations are often
      complicated, administratively burdensome, intrusive, slow, and emotionally difficult to navigate. </p>

    <h2 id="11">The Better Accommodation Project (BAP) </h2>

    <p>In September 2024, working with nine partner departments and the Privy Council Office’s Impact Canada Unit, I
      launched the Better Accommodation Project. BAP is a one-year project designed to drive transformative change in
      how federal employees with disabilities are accommodated across the public service. </p>

    <p>The project advanced a vision of providing best-in-class workplace accommodation that:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>reflect the social model of disability</li>
      <li>are timely, consistent, inclusive, and responsive; and</li>
      <li>enable all federal employees with disabilities to get the supports they need to thrive in their jobs,
        regardless of where they work.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>I am grateful that nine of my colleagues participated in the project. I am also thankful for the expertise of the
      Privy Council Office’s Impact Canada Unit, who conducted “sludge audits” of our respective workplace accommodation
      processes. A sludge audit is a way to find and remove unnecessary barriers that make a process harder, slower,
      costly, or more frustrating than it needs to be. </p>

    <p>In addition to these audits, the BAP team engaged with public servants [link to WWH] and with private and
      not-for-profit organizations. They used this information to develop BAP’s evidence-based, innovative tools to
      support departments and agencies in delivering best-in-class workplace accommodations. These tools build on past
      government projects and are based on research, the lived experiences of employees and what we have learned and
      tested so far. They are designed to help every department act now to improve how they deliver workplace
      accommodation services. While not perfect, they align with the goals of the Accessible Canada Act and the Public
      Service Accessibility Strategy. </p>

    <p>As the largest employer in Canada, the federal government has a responsibility to lead by example and use our
      resources wisely. Improving workplace accommodation is not about spending more money but about streamlining our
      approaches and making our internal processes work better for employees with disabilities. Our research
      demonstrates that the modest expense of accommodations is far outweighed by the productivity loss associated with
      our processes and when needed supports are not provided or timely. </p>

    <p>I urge every department and agency to leverage and share these resources. Let us move forward together, with
      purpose and urgency, toward our goal of becoming the most accessible and inclusive public service in the world!
    </p>

    <p>With gratitude,</p>

    <p>Tina Namiesniowski</p>

    <p>Deputy Minister Champion for Federal Employees with Disabilities</p>

    <h2 id="2">Getting started</h2>

    <p>Accommodation in the workplace is a collaboration that involves multiple teams. As you go through the package, it
      is important to note that each toolkit was designed with a specific audience in mind. These tools reference one
      another at key points, guiding readers to deeper insights or related topics. We recommend beginning with the
      toolkit that is most relevant to your needs.</p>

    <p>Further background on the project, additional research and next steps following BAP can be found in the
      "Additional information about the project" section below.</p>
